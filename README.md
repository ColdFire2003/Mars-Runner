I chose the make a endless runner with a random generated train. 
Why because it sounds fun and with the art I could make it more fun. 
I chose to make 4 skins players can use. With the original idea that the player has to buy them but I didn't get it to work.
The player can collect melon's and with every single one the player collects the player will move faster.
